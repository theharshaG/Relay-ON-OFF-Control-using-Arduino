# Relay-ON-OFF-Control-using-Arduino
Control the LED using relay model

## Project Description
This project shows how to control an LED using a relay module and Arduino.
The relay works like a switch that turns the LED ON and OFF automatically.
This project was created while learning basic Arduino and embedded systems.

## How the Project Works
- Arduino sends a signal to the relay
- When relay is ON, the LED turns ON
- When relay is OFF, the LED turns OFF
- The process repeats with a delay

## Components Used
- Arduino / ESP32
- Relay module
- LED
- 220Ω resistor
- Jumper wires

## Concepts Used
- Digital output
- Relay switching
- pinMode and digitalWrite
- Delay function

## Learning Outcomes
- Learned how to control a relay module
- Understood indirect control of devices using relay
- Improved knowledge of digital output
- Gained basic automation experience

## How to Run
1. Connect relay input to pin 8
2. Connect LED through relay contacts
3. Upload the code to Arduino
4. Power the board and observe LED blinking
